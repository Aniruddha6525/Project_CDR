# SafeLine - Android App Info

## App Motto
"Advanced AI-Powered Call Analysis System"

## Objective & Motive
The primary motive behind the Android application for this project is to provide users with a mobile, on-the-go solution to detect fraudulent activities in telecommunication. It acts as a frontline defense against scams (e.g., Banking Fraud, Tech Support Scams, UPI Payment Scams) by bringing the power of the backend's AI analysis directly to the user's smartphone.

## Core Concept
The SafeLine app leverages an AI-driven backend to analyze Call Detail Records (CDR) and audio recordings. By employing a **hybrid approach**, the system ensures high accuracy through:
1. **Acoustic Feature Analysis:** Detecting tone, stress, and anomalies in voice patterns.
2. **Linguistic Content Analysis:** Identifying suspicious keywords and phrasing patterns from transcribed text.

The app interfaces with the FastAPI backend to give real-time or near-real-time feedback (Fraud vs. Legit status and confidence score) on incoming calls or submitted audio.
